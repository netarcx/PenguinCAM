# PenguinCAM

**Onshape-to-CNC for FRC Teams**

A web-based tool for FRC robotics teams to automatically generate CNC G-code from Onshape designs. No CAM software required! Built by Team 6238, hosted for all FRC teams.

## 2.0 (in progress)

A ground-up rework, delivered as a **step wizard** (Setup → Parts → Layout → Preview) that runs both standalone (`/app`, DXF upload) and **embedded in the Onshape right-side panel** (`/onshape/element-panel`, live face-selection), sharing one codebase. Highlights:

- **Multi-part job layout:** arrange several parts on one sheet → one G-code program. The parts' combined bounding box *is* the stock (machine size is a constraint; G54 origin = bbox lower-left). Drag to move, drag-handle rotate (45° snap), multi-select group move/rotate, flip (mirror), zoom.
- **2.5D fixes:** correct handling of islands / enclosed features (N-boundary polygon nesting) and stock thickness derived from the CAD layers.
- **Onshape embedding:** popup OAuth with `SameSite=None; Secure` cookies, continuous face-selection, light/dark theme tied to Onshape's `?theme=`.
- **Multi-tool operations:** an ordered operation list per part, each operation with its own tool and its own scope (small holes on the 1/8", pockets and profile on the 1/4", edge break on a V-bit). The job groups the work by tool and pauses for a manual tool change at each switch. See [docs/MULTI_TOOL_GUIDE.md](docs/MULTI_TOOL_GUIDE.md).
- **Local mode:** `make local` runs the whole app on a laptop with no Onshape sign-in, no cloud, and no network — DXF files from disk, G-code back to disk. See [docs/LOCAL_MODE.md](docs/LOCAL_MODE.md).
- **Save:** split "Download Program / Send to Google Drive" button (Drive gated by config, remembers last choice).
- The wizard is the whole app: `/` (and `/app`) serve it full-screen in DXF-upload mode; the Onshape panel serves the same wizard with face-selection as the source.

Key files: `templates/wizard.html`, `static/wizard.js`, `static/gcode_viewer.js`, `static/source_onshape.js`; engine in `frc_cam_postprocessor.py`, routes in `frc_cam_gui_app.py`. Planned next: **V3 config / computed feeds-&-speeds** model (`docs/FEEDSandSPEEDS.md`). Run `make test` after changes.

## What is PenguinCAM?

PenguinCAM streamlines the workflow from CAD design to CNC machining for FRC teams:

1. **Design in Onshape** → Create flat plates or tubes, with holes and pockets
2. **Open app → "Send to PenguinCAM"** → One-click export from Onshape
3. **Orient & Generate** → Rotate part, auto-generate toolpaths
4. **Download or Save to Drive** → Ready to run on your CNC router

**No difficult CAM software, no manual exports!** PenguinCAM knows what FRC teams need.

Designed to feel like 3D printer slicers or laser cutter software. Get the design, orient it on the machine, and go. Launching directly from Onshape means no export/import steps, lost files or inconsistent naming. Every part designed by your team members automatically get the same CNC behavior. Students don't have to know feeds & speeds, understand ramp angles, risk machine collisions. Just select the part and go.

**Multi-team support:** Other teams can use the hosted service at https://penguincam.popcornpenguins.com! Just upload a `PenguinCAM-config.yaml` file to your Onshape documents to customize settings for your CNC machine. See "For Other FRC Teams" below.

## Quick Start for Students

### Method 1: From Onshape (Recommended) ⭐

**One-Click Workflow:**
1. **Design your part** in Onshape (flat plate with holes/pockets)
2. **Open the PenguinCAM app** in the right panel
2. **Select the top face** by clicking on it
3. **Click "Send to PenguinCAM"** in the PenguinCAM panel
4. **Orient your part** - Rotate if needed in 2D setup view
5. **Click "Generate Program"** - Review 3D preview
6. **Download or save to Drive** - Ready for CNC!

**First Time Setup:** You'll be asked to authenticate with Onshape (one time per team member)

### Method 2: Manual DXF Upload

**For offline work or non-Onshape files:**
1. **Export DXF** from your CAD software
2. **Visit** https://penguincam.popcornpenguins.com
3. **Upload DXF file** via drag-and-drop
4. **Orient & generate** - Same as above
5. **Download or save to Drive**

### Method 3: Local install (no Onshape, no internet)

**For a laptop next to the machine:**
1. **Install once:** `make install`
2. **Run:** `make local` — a browser opens on `localhost`, no sign-in
3. **Drop in a DXF**, orient, generate, download

Same wizard, same G-code. See [Local Mode](docs/LOCAL_MODE.md).

### Using more than one tool

Tick **Use several tools** on the Setup step to plan an operation list per part — drill
the small holes with a small cutter, clear pockets and profile with a big one, break the
edges with a V-bit. The program stops and tells you what to swap at each change.

**At every tool change: swap the tool, re-zero Z to the job's zero surface, and leave X
and Y alone.** That is the sacrifice board unless the job was generated with *Zero Z on:
Stock top* - each pause names the surface, as does the program header. See
[Multi-Tool Operations](docs/MULTI_TOOL_GUIDE.md) and
[the Z coordinate system](docs/Z_COORDINATE_SYSTEM.md).

### Running on the CNC

- Load G-code into your CNC controller
- Set up material and zero axes (see [Quick Reference](docs/quick-reference-card.md))
- Run the program!

## For Mentors & Setup

### Team Configuration (5 minutes)

**For teams using the hosted service:**

Create a `PenguinCAM-config.yaml` file to customize machine settings for your CNC:
- Download template: [`PenguinCAM-config-template.yaml`](https://github.com/6238/PenguinCAM/blob/main/PenguinCAM-config-template.yaml)
- Edit for your team (machine park position, controller type, feeds/speeds, etc.)
- Save as `PenguinCAM-config.yaml` and drag into your Onshape documents folder
- Done! Your settings load automatically when team members use PenguinCAM

See "For Other FRC Teams" section below for complete instructions.

## Technical Details

### G-code Operations

PenguinCAM generates optimized toolpaths:

1. **Holes (all sizes):**
   - Helical entry from center
   - Spiral clearing to final diameter
   - Compensated for exact CAD dimensions
   - Works for #10 screws, bearings, or custom

2. **Pockets:**
   - Offset inward by tool radius
   - Helical entry, then clearing passes
   - Spiral strategy for circular pockets

3. **Perimeter:**
   - Offset outward by tool radius
   - Cut with holding tabs

### Z-Axis Coordinate System

**Z=0 is at the SACRIFICE BOARD (bottom), not material top.**

This ensures:
- ✅ Consistent Z-axis setup across jobs
- ✅ Guaranteed cut-through (0.02" overcut)
- ✅ No math required when changing material thickness

See [Z_COORDINATE_SYSTEM.md](docs/Z_COORDINATE_SYSTEM.md) for details.

## Default Settings

PenguinCAM uses Team 6238 defaults optimized for FRC robotics:

**Material:**
- Thickness: 0.25" (configurable per job)
- Sacrifice board overcut: 0.008"

**Tool:**
- Default diameter: 0.157" (4mm endmill)
- Common alternatives: 1/8" (0.125"), 1/4" (0.250")

## Development

### Local Testing

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast Python dependency management. This works well with git worktrees since packages are cached globally.

1. **Clone repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-team/penguincam.git
   cd penguincam
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
   This installs `uv` if needed, creates a `.venv`, and installs all dependencies.

3. **Run G-code tests:**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. **Set environment variables** (for running the web app):
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
   export ONSHAPE_CLIENT_ID=your-onshape-id
   export ONSHAPE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-onshape-secret
   export BASE_URL=http://localhost:6238
   export AUTH_ENABLED=false  # Skip auth for local testing
   ```

   Skip this entirely if you only want the local (no-Onshape) app: `make local` needs
   none of it.

5. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   make local                         # no Onshape, no cloud, opens a browser
   # or, with the cloud integrations wired up as above:
   uv run python frc_cam_gui_app.py
   ```

6. **Visit:** http://localhost:6238

### Deployment

Push to `main` branch → Railway auto-deploys

See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for complete setup.

## For Other FRC Teams

Interested in using PenguinCAM for your team? Great! **You can use the hosted service at https://penguincam.popcornpenguins.com** - no deployment required!

### Recommended Approach: Use the Hosted Service

PenguinCAM is designed to support multiple teams using the same hosted instance. Each team can customize machine settings, feeds/speeds, and other preferences using a configuration file stored in your Onshape documents.

**Setup steps (5 minutes):**

1. **Download the configuration template:**
   - Get [`PenguinCAM-config-template.yaml`](https://github.com/6238/PenguinCAM/blob/main/PenguinCAM-config-template.yaml) from this repository

2. **Edit for your team:**
   - Update team number and name
   - Configure your CNC machine settings (park position, controller type)
   - Customize feeds/speeds if needed (optional - defaults work for most teams)
   - All values are optional! Only specify what you want to override from Team 6238 defaults

3. **Upload to Onshape:**
   - Save your edited file as `PenguinCAM-config.yaml` (exact name required)
   - Drag the file into your team's Onshape documents folder (at root level, not in a subfolder)
   - The file should appear alongside your parts and assemblies

4. **Authenticate:**
   - Visit https://penguincam.popcornpenguins.com
   - Sign in with Onshape (one-time setup per team member)
   - Your team's configuration will be automatically loaded!

**What you can customize:**
- Machine park position (important! - set for your specific CNC)
- CNC controller type (Mach3, Mach4, LinuxCNC, etc.)
- Default tool diameter shown in UI
- Feeds, speeds, and ramp angles per material
- Tab sizes and spacing
- Z-axis reference heights
- Google Drive integration settings

**Example:** If you have an Omio X-8 with Mach3, you only need to override:
```yaml
team:
  number: 1234
  name: "Your Team Name"
machine:
  name: "Omio X-8"
  controller: "Mach3"
  park_position:
    x: 1.0
    y: 30.0
```

All other values automatically use proven Team 6238 defaults.

### Advanced: Self-Hosting (Optional)

Want to run your own instance? You can deploy PenguinCAM yourself:

**Setup steps:**
1. Fork this repository
2. Follow [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) to deploy on Railway
3. Configure Google OAuth for your Workspace
4. Set up Onshape API credentials
5. Customize branding (logo, domain, etc.)

The setup takes about 1-2 hours but then requires minimal maintenance.

**Most teams should use the hosted service above** - it's simpler and includes automatic updates!
